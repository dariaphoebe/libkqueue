 * Ensure that kevent_copyout() on Solaris does not rely on having
   the filter lock. Linux has already been converted.

 * Fix the crasher w/ corruption in test/vnode.c

 * Add the kevent64() syscall as implemented on MacOS X. This guarantees
   that 64-bit values can be used in the 'udata' field on 32-bit platforms.

 * Include <sys/types.h> or convert u_int to uint32_t in event.h

 * Check other filters for the EV_DISPATCH bug that was fixed in r252.
