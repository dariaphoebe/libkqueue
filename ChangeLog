2009-11-10  v0.3    r84
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  * The EVFILT_USER filter has been implemented, but needs additional
    testing.

  * The EVFILT_PROC filter is partially implemented on Linux, but is
    currently broken.

  * The unit tests have been moved to a separate subdirectory and now
    function under OpenBSD 4.4 using the native kqueue(2) and kevent(2)
    system calls.

  * The kqueue_free() function has been removed. 

  * A helper thread performs garbage collection when close(2) is called
    on the file descriptor returned by kqueue().

  * All symbols in <sys/event.h> that are not implemented are now
    undefined.

  * Major internal reorganization of the source tree.

  * A copy-and-paste error in vnode.c has been fixed.

  * The pthreads library is now required.

2009-11-07  v0.2    r59

    * Implement EVFILT_TIMER on Linux.

    * Fix another 'make install' problem reported by Mario Schwalbe.

    * Do not link the test program with the pthreads library.

    * pkg-config no longer requires linking with -lpthread and -lrt.
