2010-03-28  v0.6    r238
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  * Experimental Linux kernel module.

  * Implement knote modification for signals.

  * Implement POSIX signal.c 

2010-02-09  v0.5    r200
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  * Prevent namespace pollution by hiding all ELF symbols except for 
    kqueue() and kevent().

  * Add reference counting to the garbage collection mechanism so that
    a kqueue object is never destroyed while multiple threads are using
    it.

  * Improve scalability by using red-black trees instead of linked lists.

  * Refactor the internal API to promote modularity and code reuse. 
    Five methods are added to each filter: create, modify, delete,
    enable, disable. These replace the copyin() method, which was
    overly complicated.

  * Remove the fine-grained locking at the filter level, and replace
    it with coarse locking inside kevent(). This simplifys the locking
    implementation and provides a stronger guarantee of reentrancy.

  * Initial attempt at writing a Linux kernel module. It fails to
    link because sys_epoll_create() and other event-related syscalls
    are not available to kernelspace (?). Need to ask LKML for guidance.

  * Make unit tests threadsafe and created a stresstest which runs
    the unit tests in parallel.

  * Use helper functions to reduce the amount of duplicate code in the
    unit tests.

2009-12-26  v0.4    r133
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  * Incomplete and experimental support for Solaris added.

  * Lots of work on the test suite.

  * Replace the buggy GC thread with an event-based alternative.

  * Do not implicitly set EV_CLEAR in the EVFILT_USER filter.

  * Adjust the eventlist when EV_RECEIPT causes it to be modified.

2009-11-10  v0.3    r84
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  * The EVFILT_USER filter has been implemented, but needs additional
    testing.

  * The EVFILT_PROC filter is partially implemented on Linux, but is
    currently broken.

  * The unit tests have been moved to a separate subdirectory and now
    function under OpenBSD 4.4 using the native kqueue(2) and kevent(2)
    system calls.

  * The kqueue_free() function has been removed. 

  * A helper thread performs garbage collection when close(2) is called
    on the file descriptor returned by kqueue().

  * All symbols in <sys/event.h> that are not implemented are now
    undefined.

  * Major internal reorganization of the source tree.

  * A copy-and-paste error in vnode.c has been fixed.

  * The pthreads library is now required.

2009-11-07  v0.2    r59
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  * Implement EVFILT_TIMER on Linux.

  * Fix another 'make install' problem reported by Mario Schwalbe.

  * Do not link the test program with the pthreads library.

  * pkg-config no longer requires linking with -lpthread and -lrt.

2009-11-05  v0.1     r49
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  * Initial stable release.
